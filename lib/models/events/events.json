Everyone were elated seeing each other after such a long interval of time. They remembered the days when engineering was studied in a completely different way comparing today and chuckled together recollecting their golden memories from the campus after 50 years. Interacting with the current students and getting to know about the current status of the college made them feel energized such that they even forgot their age. Everyone were feeling sentimental coming to college after such a long time as if their one of the precious part is still left here.",
